 2.1  INTRODUCTION 
Let us imagine a situation where you are a proprietor and you take copies of your books of 
account to five different accountants. You ask them to prepare the financial statements on the 
basis of the above records and to calculate the profits of the business for the year. After few 
days, they are ready with the financial statements and all the five accountants have calculated 
five different amounts of profits and that too with very wide variations among them. Guess in 
such a situation what impact would it leave on you about accounting profession. To avoid this, 
a generally accepted set of rules have been developed. This generally accepted set of rules 
provides unity of understanding and unity of approach in the practice of accounting and also 
in better preparation and presentation of the financial statements. 
Accounting is a language of the business. Financial statements prepared by the accountant 
communicate financial information to the various stakeholders for decision-making purpose. 
Therefore, it is important that financial statements prepared by different organizations should

be prepared on uniform basis. Also, there should be consistency over a period of time in the 
preparation of these financial statements. If every accountant starts following his own norms 
and notions for accounting of different items, then there will be an utter confusion. 
To avoid confusion and to achieve uniformity, accounting process is applied within the 
conceptual framework of ‘Generally Accepted Accounting Principles’(GAAPs). The term GAAPs 
is used to describe rules developed for the preparation of the financial statements and are 
called concepts, conventions, postulates, principles etc. These GAAPs are the backbone of the 
accounting information system, without which the whole system cannot even stand erectly. 
These principles are the ground rules, which define the parameters and constraints within which 
accounting reports are generated. Accounting principles are basic norms and assumptions on 
which the whole accounting system has been developed and established. Accountant also 
adheres to various accounting standards issued by the regulatory authority for the 
standardization of accounting policies to be followed under specific circumstances. These 
conceptual frameworks, GAAPs and accounting standards are considered as the theory base of 
accounting. Globally, for achieving the standardization, countries use the framework under 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, countries may apply their 
respective GAAPs and related conceptual frameworks. For example, in India, companies are 
required to use AS or Ind-AS frameworks as applicable. 
 2.2 ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS 
Accounting concepts define the assumptions on the basis of which financial statements of a 
business entity are prepared. Certain concepts are perceived, assumed and accepted in 
accounting to provide a unifying structure and internal logic to accounting process. The word 
concept means idea or notion, which has universal application. Financial transactions are 
interpreted in the light of the concepts, which govern accounting methods. Concepts are 
those basic assumptions and conditions, which form the basis upon which the accountancy 
has been laid. Unlike physical science, accounting concepts are only result of broad consensus. 
These accounting concepts lay the foundation on the basis of which the accounting principles 
are formulated. 
 2.3  ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES 
“Accounting principles are a body of doctrines commonly associated with the theory and 
procedures of accounting serving as an explanation of current practices and as a guide for 
selection of conventions or procedures where alternatives exist.” 
Accounting principles must satisfy the following conditions: 
1. 
They should be based on real assumptions;

2. 
They must be simple, understandable and explanatory; 
3. 
They must be followed consistently; 
4. 
They should be able to reflect future predictions; 
5. 
They should be informational for the users. 
 2.4  ACCOUNTING CONVENTIONS 
Accounting conventions emerge out of accounting practices, commonly known as accounting 
principles, adopted by various organizations over a period of time. These conventions are 
derived by usage and practice. The accountancy bodies of the world may change any of the 
convention to improve the quality of accounting information. Accounting conventions need 
not have universal application. 
In the study material, the terms ‘accounting concepts’, ‘accounting principles’ and ‘accounting 
conventions’ have been used interchangeably to mean those basic points of agreement on 
which financial accounting theory and practice are founded. 
 2.5  CONCEPTS, PRINCIPLES AND CONVENTIONS - AN 
OVERVIEW 
Now we shall study in detail the various accounting concepts on which accounting is based. 
The following are the widely accepted accounting concepts: 
(a) 
Entity concept: Entity concept states that business enterprise is a separate identity apart 
from its owner. Accountants should treat a business as distinct from its owner. Business 
transactions are recorded in the business books of accounts and owner’s transactions in 
his personal books of accounts. The practice of distinguishing the affairs of the business 
from the personal affairs of the owners originated only in the early days of the double-
entry book-keeping. This concept helps in keeping business affairs free from the 
influence of the personal affairs of the owner. This basic concept is applied to all the 
organizations whether sole proprietorship or partnership or corporate entities. 
Entity concept keeps the business separate from its owner. In a way, the entity concept 
helps to ascertain how much amount of money is due to the owner in form of his 
capital and share of profits earned. It also helps to perform accounting from the point 
of view of the business and not that of the owner. For example, if a person runs a 
business and pays money from his own pocket for his son’s school fee, it will not 
constitute a transaction in the books of the business. However, if the person withdraws

1.35 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
 
money from the business to pay for his son’s school fee it will constitute a transaction 
to be recorded in the books of the business as amount withdrawn by the owner. 
Entity concept means that the enterprise is liable to the owner for capital investment 
made by the owner.  Since the owner invested capital, which is also called risk capital, 
he has claim on the profit of the enterprise. A portion of profit which is apportioned 
to the owner and is immediately payable becomes current liability in the case of 
corporate entities. 
Example 1: Mr. X started business investing ` 7,00,000 with which he purchased 
machinery for ` 5,00,000 and maintained the balance in hand. The financial position of 
the will be as follows: 
 
` 
Capital 
7,00,000 
Machinery 
5,00,000 
Cash 
2,00,000 
This means that the enterprise owes to Mr. X ` 7,00,000. Now if Mr. X spends ` 5,000 
to meet his family expenses from the business fund, then it should not be taken as 
business expenses and would be charged to his capital account (i.e., his investment 
would be reduced by ` 5,000). Following the entity concept the revised financial 
position would be 
Liability

Capital

Less : Drawings 
(5,000) 
6,95,000 
Machinery 
 
5,00,000 
Cash 
 
1,95,000 
(b) 
Money measurement concept: As per this concept, only those transactions, which can 
be measured in terms of money are recorded. Since money is the medium of exchange 
and the standard of economic value, this concept requires that those transactions 
alone that are capable of being measured in terms of money be only to be recorded in 
the books of accounts. Transactions, even if, they affect the results of the business 
materially, are not recorded if they are not convertible in monetary terms. 
For example, a business owning a factory on a piece of 1 acre of land, with an office 
building with 2 floors, having 20 computers, and 10 units of machine cannot show 
these items under different measurement units. These items need to be expressed in 
monetary terms. The factory price might be 50 Cr, cost of land might be 30 Cr, building

ACCOUNTING 
1.36 
 
1.36 
with a cost of 15 Cr, computers at a cost of 10 lac and machines with a cost of 10 Cr 
need to be recorded. 
However, the concept has its own limitations. Transactions and events that cannot be 
expressed in terms of money are not recorded in the business books. For example; 
employees of the organization are, no doubt, the assets of the organizations but their 
measurement in monetary terms is not possible therefore, not included in the books 
of account of the organization. Measuring unit for money is taken as the currency of 
the ruling country i.e., the ruling currency of a country provides a common 
denomination for the value of material objects. 
It may be mentioned that when transactions occur across the boundary of a country, one 
may see many currencies. Suppose a businessman sells goods worth ` 50 lakhs at home 
and he also sells goods worth of 1 lakh Euro in the United States. What is his total sales? 
` 50 lakhs plus 1 lakh Euro. 
These are not amenable to even arithmetic treatment. So, transactions are to be 
recorded at uniform monetary unit i.e. in one currency. Suppose EURO 1 = ` 71. 
Total Sales = ` 50 lakhs plus 71 lakhs = ` 121 lakhs. Money Measurement Concept 
imparts the essential flexibility for measurement and interpretation of accounting data. 
This concept ignores that money is an inelastic yardstick for measurement as it is based 
on the implicit assumption that purchasing power of the money is not of sufficient 
importance as to require adjustment. For example, a unit of land purchased 10 years 
ago for 40 Cr and a similar unit of land purchased now for 90 Cr will still be shown at 
the respective values, i.e., total of 130 Cr. Though in real world, the true value of the 
units together might be 180 Cr (90 + 90). Accordingly, accounting does not give a true 
and fair view of the affairs of the business. 
As mentioned earlier, many material transactions and events are not recorded in the 
books of accounts just because they cannot be measured in monetary terms. Yet it is 
used for accounting purposes because it is not possible to adopt a better measurement 
scale. 
Entity and money measurement are viewed as the basic concepts on which other 
procedural concepts hinge. 
(c) 
Periodicity concept: This is also called the concept of definite accounting period. As per 
going concern’ concept an indefinite life of the entity is assumed. For a business entity 
it causes inconvenience to measure performance achieved by the entity in the ordinary 
course of business. 
© The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
 
1.37 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
If a textile mill lasts for 100 years, it is not desirable to measure its performance as well 
as financial position only at the end of its life. 
So, a small but workable fraction of time is chosen out of infinite life cycle of the 
business entity for measuring performance and looking at the financial position. 
Generally, one year period is taken up for performance measurement and appraisal of 
financial position. However, it may also be 6 months or 9 months or 15 months. 
According to this concept accounts should be prepared after every period & not at the 
end of the life of the entity. Usually, this period is one calendar year. We generally follow 
from 1st April of a year to 31st March of the immediately following year. 
Thus, for performance appraisal it is not necessary to look into the revenue and 
expenses of an unduly long time-frame. This concept makes the accounting system 
workable and the term ‘accrual’ meaningful. If one thinks of indefinite time-frame, 
nothing will accrue. There cannot be unpaid expenses and non- receipt of revenue. 
Accrued expenses or accrued revenue is only with reference to a finite time-frame 
which is called accounting period. 
Thus, the periodicity concept facilitates in: 
(i) 
Comparing of financial statements of different periods 
(ii) 
Uniform and consistent accounting treatment for ascertaining the profit and 
assets of the business 
(iii) 
Matching periodic revenues with expenses for getting correct results of the 
business operations 
(d) 
Accrual concept: Under accrual concept, the effects of transactions and other events 
are recognised on mercantile basis i.e., when they occur (and not as cash or a cash 
equivalent is received or paid) and they are recorded in the accounting records and 
reported in the financial statements of the periods   to which they relate. Financial 
statements prepared on the accrual basis inform users not only of past events involving 
the payment and receipt of cash but also of obligations to pay cash in the future and 
of resources that represent cash to be received in the future. 
To understand accrual assumption knowledge of revenues and expenses is required. 
Revenue is the gross inflow of cash, receivables and other consideration arising in the 
course of the ordinary activities of an enterprise from sale of goods, from rendering 
services and from the use by others of enterprise’s resources yielding interest, royalties 
and dividends. For example, (1) Mr. X started a cloth merchandising. He invested  
` 50,000, bought merchandise worth ` 50,000. He sold such merchandise for ` 60,000. 
Customers paid him ` 50,000 cash and assure him to pay ` 10,000 shortly. His revenue

ACCOUNTING 
1.38 
 
1.38 
is ` 60,000. It arose in the ordinary course of cloth business; Mr. X received ` 50,000 in 
cash and ` 10,000 by way of receivables. 
Take another example; (2) an electricity supply undertaking supplies electricity 
spending ` 16,00,000 for fuel and wages and collects electricity bill in one month  
` 20,00,000 by way of electricity charges. This is also revenue which arose from 
rendering services. 
Lastly, (3) Mr. A invested ` 1,00,000 in a business. He purchased a machine paying  
` 1,00,000. He rented it for ` 20,000 annually to Mr. B. ` 20,000 is the revenue of Mr. A; 
it arose from the use PG the enterprise’s resources. 
Expense is a cost relating to the operations of an accounting period or to the revenue 
earned during the period or the benefits of which do not extend beyond that period. 
In the first example, Mr. X spent ` 50,000 to buy the merchandise; it is the expense of 
generating revenue of ` 60,000. In the second instance ` 16,00,000 are the expenses. 
Also whenever any asset is used it has a finite life to generate benefit. Suppose, the 
machine purchased by Mr. A in the third example will last for 10 years only. Then  
` 10,000 is the expense every year relating to the cost of machinery. 
Accrual means recognition of revenue and costs as they are earned or incurred and 
not as money is received or paid. The accrual concept relates to measurement of income, 
identifying assets and liabilities. 
Example: Mr. J D buys clothing of ` 50,000 paying cash ` 20,000 and sells at ` 60,000 of 
which customers paid only ` 50,000. 
His revenue is ` 60,000, not ` 50,000 cash received. Expense (i.e., cost incurred for the 
revenue) is ` 50,000, not ` 20,000 cash paid. So the accrual concept based profit is  
` 10,000 (Revenue – Expenses).  
As per Accrual Concept: Revenue – Expenses = Profit 
Accrual Concept provides the foundation on which the structure of present-day 
accounting has been developed. 
Alternative as per Cash basis 
Cash received in ordinary course of business – Cash paid in ordinary course of business 
= profit. 
Timing of revenue and expense booking could be different from cash receipt or paid. 
(i) when cash received before revenue 
is booked

a liability is created when cash is

(ii) when cash received after revenue is 
booked 
-  
an asset called Trade receivables is 
created 
(iii) when cash paid before expense is 
booked 
-  
creates an asset called Trade Advance 
when cash is paid in advance 
(iv) when cash paid after expense is 
booked 
- 
creates a liability called payables or 
Trade 
payables 
or 
outstanding 
liabilities 
(e) 
Matching concept: In this concept, all expenses matched with the revenue of that 
period should only be taken into consideration. In the financial statements of the 
organization if any revenue is recognized then expenses related to earn that revenue 
should also be recognized. 
This concept is based on accrual concept as it considers the occurrence of expenses 
and income and do not concentrate on actual inflow or outflow of cash. This leads to 
adjustment of certain items like prepaid and outstanding expenses, unearned or 
accrued incomes. 
It is not necessary that every expense identify every income. Some expenses are directly 
related to the revenue and some are time bound. For example:- selling expenses are 
directly related to sales but rent, salaries etc are recorded on accrual basis for a 
particular accounting period. In other words periodicity concept has also been followed 
while applying matching concept. 
Mr. P K started cloth business. He purchased 10,000 pcs. garments @ ` 100 per piece and 
sold 8,000 pcs. @ ` 150 per piece during the accounting period of 12 months 1st January 
to 31st December, 2022. He paid shop rent @ ` 3,000 per month for 11 months and paid 
` 8,00,000 to the suppliers of garments and received ` 10,00,000 from the customers. 
Let us see how the accrual and periodicity concepts operate. 
Periodicity Concept fixes up the time-frame for which the performance is to be 
measured and financial position is to be appraised. Here, it is January 2022 - December, 
2022. Therefore, revenues and expenses are to be measured for the year 2022 and 
assets and liabilities are to be ascertained as on 31st December, 2022. 
Accrual Concept operates to measure revenue of ` 12,00,000 (arising out of sale of 
garments 8,000 Pcs × ` 150) which accrued during 2022, not the cash received  
` 10,00,000 and also the expenses correctly. Shop rent for 12 months is an expense item 
amounting to ` 36,000, not ` 33,000 the cash paid.

Should the accountant treat ` 10,00,000 as expenses for purchase of merchandise? And 
should he treat ` 1,64,000 as profit? (Revenue ` 12,00,000-Merchandise ` 10,00,000. 
Shop Rent ` 36,000). Obviously, the answer is No. Matching links revenue with expenses. 
Revenue – Expenses = Profit 
But this unqualified equation may create misconception.  
It should be defined as: Periodic Profit = Periodic Revenue – Matched Expenses 
From the revenue of an accounting period such expenses are deducted which are 
expended to generate the revenue to determine profit of that period. 
In the given example revenue relates to only sale of 8,000 pcs. of garments. Therefore, 
the cost of 8,000 pcs of garments should be treated as expenses. 
 
` 
` 
Thus,  Profit = Revenue

Thus, accrual, matching and periodicity concepts work together for income 
measurement and recognition of assets and liabilities. 
(f) 
Going Concern concept: The financial statements are normally prepared on the 
assumption that an enterprise is a going concern and will continue in operation for the 
foreseeable future. Hence, it is assumed that the enterprise has neither the intention 
nor the need to liquidate or curtail materially the scale of its operations; if such an 
© The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
 
1.41 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
intention or need exists, the financial statements may have to be prepared on a 
different basis and, if so, the basis used needs to be disclosed. 
The valuation of assets of a business entity is dependent on this assumption. 
Traditionally, accountants follow historical cost in majority of the cases. 
Suppose Mr. X purchased a machine for his business paying ` 5,00,000 out of ` 7,00,000 
invested by him. He also paid transportation expenses and installation charges 
amounting to ` 70,000. If he is still willing to continue the business, his financial 
position will be as follows: 
BALANCE SHEET 
Liability 
` Assets 
` 
Capital 
7,00,000 Machinery  
5,70,000 
 
 Cash 
1,30,000 
 
7,00,000  
7,00,000 
Now if he decides to back out and desires to sell the machine, it may fetch more than 
or less than ` 5,70,000. So his financial position should be different. If going concern 
concept is taken, increase/ decrease in the value of assets in the short-run is ignored. 
The concept indicates that assets are kept for generating benefit in future, not for 
immediate sale; current change in the asset value is not realisable and so it should not 
be counted. 
This can be understood differently with some examples we may have come across in 
real life. Recently during pandemic, many businesses were shutting down due to heavy 
losses. If the financial statement of these entities does not reveal the fact of winding 
up due to losses, it will mislead the stakeholders. And, a sudden news of the business 
shutting down would be a setback to those stakeholders.  
Therefore, entities need to assess at the time of preparation of financial statements, 
whether they are likely to continue to operate their business. If the Going Concern 
assumption is under question,  the same information should be communicated to the 
stakeholders. 
(g) 
Cost concept: By this concept, the value of an asset is to be determined on the basis of 
historical cost, in other words, acquisition cost. Although there are various measurement 
bases, accountants traditionally prefer this concept in the interests of objectivity. When 
a machine is acquired by paying ` 5,00,000, following cost concept the value of the 
machine is taken as ` 5,00,000. It is highly objective and free from all bias. Other 
measurement bases are not so objective. Current cost of an asset is not easily 
determinable. If the asset is purchased on 1.1.1995 and such model is not available in

ACCOUNTING 
1.42 
 
1.42 
the market, it becomes difficult to determine which model is the appropriate equivalent 
to the existing one. Similarly, unless the machine is actually sold, realisable value will 
give only a hypothetical figure. Lastly, present value base is highly subjective because 
to know the value of the asset one has to chase the uncertain future. 
However, the cost concept creates a lot of distortion too as outlined below: 
(a) 
In an inflationary situation when prices of all commodities go up on an average, 
acquisition cost loses its relevance. For example, a piece of land purchased on 
1.1.1995 for ` 2,000 may cost ` 1,00,000 as on 1.1.2022. So if the accountant 
makes valuation of asset at historical cost, the accounts will not reflect the true 
position. 
(b) 
Historical cost-based accounts may lose comparability. Mr. X invested ` 1,00,000 
in a machine on 1.1.1995 which produces ` 50,000 cash inflow during the year 
2022, while Mr. Y invested ` 5,00,000 in a machine on 1.1.2005 which produced  
` 50,000 cash inflows during the year. Mr. X earned at the rate 50% while Mr. Y 
earned at the rate 10%. Who is more efficient? Since the assets are recorded at 
the historical cost, the results are not comparable. Obviously, it is a corollary  
to (a). 
(c) 
Many assets do not have acquisition costs. Human assets of an enterprise are an 
example. The cost concept fails to recognise such asset although it is a very 
important asset of any organization.  
Many other controversial issues have arisen in financial accounting that revolves 
around the cost concept which will be discussed at the advanced stage. However, later 
on we shall see that in many circumstances, the cost convention is not followed. See 
conservatism concept for an example, which will be discussed later on in this unit. 
(h) 
Realisation concept: It closely follows the cost concept. Any change in value of an 
asset is to be recorded only when the business realises it. When an asset is recorded at 
its historical cost of ` 5,00,000 and even if its current cost is ` 15,00,000 such change is 
not counted unless there is certainty that such change will materialize. 
However, accountants follow a more conservative path. They try to cover all probable 
losses but do not count any probable gain. That is to say, if accountants anticipate 
decrease in value they count it, but if there is increase in value they ignore it until it is 
realised. Economists are highly critical about the realisation concept. According to 
them, this concept creates value distortion and makes accounting meaningless.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
 
Example: Mr.  X purchased a piece of land on 1.1.1995 paying ` 2,000. Its current 
market value is ` 1,02,000 on 31.12.2022. Should the accountant show the land at  
` 2,000 following cost concept and ignoring `1,00,000 value increase since it is not 
realised? If he does so, the financial position would be: 
BALANCE SHEET 
Liabilities 
` 
Asset 
` 
Capital 
2,000 
Land 
2,000 
2,000

Is it not proper to show it in the following manner?

1,00,000 
Land

1,02,000 
Now-a-days the revaluation of assets has become a widely accepted practice when the 
change in value is of permanent nature. Accountants adjust such value change through 
creation of revaluation (capital) reserve. 
Thus, the going concern, cost concept and realization concept gives the valuation criteria. 
(i) 
Dual aspect concept: This concept is the core of double entry book-keeping. Every 
transaction or event has two aspects: 
(1) 
It increases one Asset and decreases other Asset; 
(2) 
It increases an Asset and simultaneously increases Liability; 
(3) 
It decreases one Asset, increases another Asset; 
(4) 
It decreases one Asset, decreases a Liability.  
Alternatively: 
(5) 
It increases one Liability, decreases other Liability; 
(6) 
It increases a Liability, increases an Asset; 
(7) 
It decreases Liability, increases other Liability; 
(8) 
It decreases Liability, decreases an Asset.

We may conclude that every transaction and event has two aspects.  
This gives basic accounting equation : 
Equity (E) + Liabilities (L) = Assets (A)  
or 
Equity (E)= Assets (A) – Liabilities(L) 
Or, Equity + Long Term Liabilities + Current Liabilities = Fixed Assets + Current 
Assets  
Or, Equity + Long Term Liabilities = Fixed Assets + (Current Assets – Current 
Liabilities)  
Or, Equity = Fixed Assets + Working Capital – Long Term Liabilities

For the year ended March 31, 2021: 
Equity = 
Capital 
` 1,00,000 
Liabilities 
= Bank Loan + Trade Payables 
 
 
` 1,00,000 + ` 75,000 = ` 1,75,000 
Assets =   
Fixed Assets + Trade Receivables + Inventory + Cash & Bank 
 
 
` 1,25,000 + ` 75,000 + ` 70,000 + ` 5,000 = ` 2,75,000 
 
 
Equity + Liabilities = Assets 
 
 
` 1,00,000 + ` 1,75,000 = 2,75,000 
For the year ended March 31, 2022: 
Assets = ` 1,10,000 + ` 80,000 + ` 80,000 + ` 6,000 = ` 2,76,000 
Liabilities = ` 1,00,000 + ` 70,000 = ` 1,70,000 
Equity = Assets – Liabilities = ` 2,76,000 – ` 1,70,000 = ` 1,06,000 Profits = New Equity 
– Old Equity = ` 1,06,000 – `1,00,000 = ` 6,000 
(j) 
Conservatism: Conservatism states that the accountant should not anticipate any 
future income however they should provide for all possible losses. When there are 
many alternative values of an asset, an accountant should choose the method which 
leads to the lesser value. Later on, we shall see that the golden rule of current assets 
valuation - ‘cost or market price whichever is lower’ originated from this concept. 
The Realisation Concept also states that no change should be counted unless it has 
materialised. The Conservatism Concept puts a further brake on it. It is not prudent to 
count unrealised gain but it is desirable to guard against all possible losses.

1.47 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
For this concept there should be at least three qualitative characteristics of financial 
statements, namely, 
(i) 
Prudence, i.e., judgement about the possible future losses which are to be 
guarded, as well as gains which are uncertain. 
(ii) 
Neutrality, i.e., unbiased outlook is required to identify and record such possible 
losses, as well as to exclude uncertain gains, 
(iii) 
Faithful representation of alternative values. 
This concept is of wider importance to investors since they would need to take a 
decision about their money being invested in the business. Recording future profits 
when these have not been earned would suggest that the business is booming, and 
the investors would be tempted to put more money into the same. However, eventually 
if the profit is not earned, the investors are likely to loose their investments. At the 
same time, if the entity expects to make a loss in future, it is prudent to show that loss 
in the books in present itself. This acts as a safeguard for the investors as they would 
be prudent to make the investment decisions. For example: Mr. X runs a business of 
computers. He purchased 10 computers at a cost of ` 20,000 each and is expecting to 
be able to sell these computers at the current market price of ` 25,000 each. Note that 
the conservatism principle does not allow to recognise the profit on the computers 
unless the sale has been made. Since, this is a future profit, Mr. X needs to follow a 
prudent approach while recording the transactions in his books and ignore the profit 
until it is earned  
However, before sale, the market price of the computers declines to ` 17,000 each. 
Under the conservatism approach, Mr. X needs to recognise that loss of ` 3,000 per 
computer, even though the sale has not been made. 
Many accounting authors, however, are of the view that conservatism essentially leads to 
understatement of income and wealth and it should not be the basis for the preparation 
of financial statements. 
(k) 
Consistency: In order to achieve comparability of the financial statements of an 
enterprise through time, the accounting policies are followed consistently from one 
period to another; a change in an accounting policy is made only in certain exceptional 
circumstances. 
The concept of consistency is applied particularly when alternative methods of 
accounting are equally acceptable. For example, a company may adopt any of several 
methods of depreciation such as written-down-value method, straight-line method, 
etc. Likewise, there are many methods for valuation of inventories. But following the 
principle of consistency it is advisable that the company should follow consistently

ACCOUNTING 
1.48 
 
1.48 
over years the same method of depreciation or the same method of valuation of 
Inventories which is chosen. However, in some cases though there is no inconsistency, 
they may seem to be inconsistent apparently. In case of valuation of Inventories if the 
company applies the principle ‘at cost or market price whichever is lower’ and if this 
principle accordingly results in the valuation of Inventories in one year at cost price 
and the market price in the other year, there is no inconsistency here. It is only an 
application of the principle. 
But the concept of consistency does not imply non-flexibility as not to allow the 
introduction of improved method of accounting. 
An enterprise should change its accounting policy in any of the following 
circumstances only: 
a. 
To bring the books of accounts in accordance with the issued Accounting 
Standards. 
b. 
To comply with the provision of law. 
c. 
When under changed circumstances, it is felt that new method will reflect a true 
and fair picture in the financial statement. 
(l) 
Materiality: Materiality principle permits other concepts to be ignored, if the effect is 
not considered material. This principle is an exception to full disclosure principle. 
According to materiality principle, all the items having significant economic effect on 
the business of the enterprise should be disclosed in the financial statements and any 
insignificant item which will only increase the work of the accountant but will not be 
relevant to the users’ need should not be disclosed in the financial statements. 
The term materiality is the subjective term. It is on the judgement, common sense and 
discretion of the accountant that which item is material and which is not. For example, 
stationary purchased by the organization though not used fully in the accounting year 
purchased still shown as an expense of that year because of the materiality concept. 
Similarly, depreciation on small items like books, calculators etc. is taken as 100% in 
the year of purchase though used by the entity for more than a year. This is because 
the amount for books or calculator is very small to be shown in the balance sheet 
though it is the asset of the company. 
The materiality depends not only upon the amount of the item but also upon the size 
of the business, nature and level of information, level of the person making the 
decision etc. Moreover, an item material to one person may be immaterial to another 
person. What is important is that omission of any information should not impair the 
decision-making of various users.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
 2.6  FUNDAMENTAL ACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS 
There are three fundamental accounting assumptions: 
(i) 
Going Concern 
(ii) 
Consistency 
(iii) 
Accrual 
All the above three fundamental accounting assumptions have already been explained in para 2.5. 
If nothing has been written about the fundamental accounting assumption in the financial 
statements then it is assumed that they have already been followed in their preparation of 
financial statements. However, if any of the above-mentioned fundamental accounting 
assumption is not followed then this fact should be specifically disclosed. 
 2.7  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The aim of accounting is to keep systematic records to ascertain financial performance and 
financial position of an entity and to communicate the relevant financial information to the 
interested user groups. The financial statements are basic means through which the 
management of an entity makes public communication of the financial information along with 
selected quantitative details. They are structured financial representations of the financial 
position and the performance of an enterprise. To have a record of all business transactions 
and also to determine whether all these transactions resulted in either ‘profit or loss’ for the 
period, all the entities will prepare financial statements viz., balance sheet, profit and loss 
account, cash flow statement etc. by following various accounting concepts, principles, and 
conventions which have been already discussed in detail. 
2.7.1 
Qualitative Characteristics of financial Statements 
Qualitative characteristics are the attributes that make the information provided in financial 
statements useful to users. The following are the important qualitative characteristics of the 
financial statements: 
1. 
Understandability: An essential quality of the information provided in financial 
statements is that it must be readily understandable by users. For this purpose, it is 
assumed that users have a reasonable knowledge of business, economic activities and 
accounting and study the information with reasonable diligence. Information about 
complex matters that should be included in the financial statements because of its 
relevance to the economic decision-making needs of users should not be excluded 
merely on the ground that it may be too difficult for certain users to understand.

2. 
Relevance: To be useful, information must be relevant to the decision-making needs 
of users. Information has the quality of relevance when it influences the economic 
decisions of users by helping them evaluate past, present or future events or 
confirming, or correcting, their past evaluations. 
The predictive and confirmatory roles of information are interrelated. For example, 
information about the current level and structure of asset holdings has value to users 
when they endeavour to predict the ability of the enterprise to take advantage of 
opportunities and its ability to react to adverse situations. The same information plays 
a confirmatory role in respect of past predictions about, for example, the way in which 
the enterprise would be structured or the outcome of planned operations. 
Information about financial position and past performance is frequently used as the 
basis for predicting future financial position and performance and other matters in 
which users are directly interested, such as dividend and wage payments, share price 
movements and the ability of the enterprise to meet its commitments as they fall due. 
To have predictive value, information need not be in the form of an explicit forecast. 
The ability to make predictions from financial statements is enhanced, however, by the 
manner in which information on past transactions and events is displayed. For example, 
the predictive value of the statement of profit and loss is enhanced if unusual, 
abnormal and infrequent items of income and expense are separately disclosed. 
3. 
Reliability: To be useful, information must also be reliable, Information has the quality 
of reliability when it is free from material error and bias and can be depended upon by 
users to represent faithfully that which it either purports to represent or could 
reasonably be expected to represent. 
Information may be relevant but so unreliable in nature or representation that its 
recognition may be potentially misleading. For example, if the validity and amount of 
a claim for damages under a legal action against the enterprise are highly uncertain, 
it may be inappropriate for the enterprise to recognise the amount of the claim in the 
balance sheet, although it may be appropriate to disclose the amount and 
circumstances of the claim. 
4. 
Comparability: Users must be able to compare the financial statements of an enterprise 
through time in order to identify trends in its financial position, performance and cash 
flows. Users must also be able to compare the financial statements of different 
enterprises in order to evaluate their relative financial position, performance and cash 
flows. Hence, the measurement and display of the financial effects of like transactions 
and other events must be carried out in a consistent way throughout an enterprise and 
over time for that enterprise and in a consistent way for different enterprises. 
© The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
 
1.51 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
An important implication of the qualitative characteristic of comparability is that users 
be informed of the accounting policies employed in the preparation of the financial 
statements, any changes in those polices and the effects of such changes. Users need 
to be able to identify differences between the accounting policies for like transactions 
and other events used by the same enterprise from period to period and by different 
enterprises. Compliance with Accounting Standards, including the disclosure of the 
accounting policies used by the enterprise, helps to achieve comparability. 
The need for comparability should not be confused with mere uniformity and should 
not be allowed to become an impediment to the introduction of improved accounting 
standards. It is not appropriate for an enterprise to continue accounting in the same 
manner for a transaction or other event if the policy adopted is not in keeping with the 
qualitative characteristics of relevance and reliability. It is also inappropriate for an 
enterprise to leave its accounting policies unchanged when more relevant and reliable 
alternatives exist. 
Users wish to compare the financial position, performance and cash flows of an 
enterprise over time. Hence, it is important that the financial statements show 
corresponding information for the preceding period(s). 
The four principal qualitative characteristics are understandability, relevance, 
reliability and comparability. 
5. 
Materiality:  The relevance of information is affected by its materiality. Information is 
material if its misstatement (i.e., omission or erroneous statement) could influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial information. Materiality 
depends on the size and nature of the item or error, judged in the particular 
circumstances of its misstatement. Materiality provides a threshold or cut-off point 
rather than being a primary qualitative characteristic which the information must have 
if it is to be useful. 
6. 
Faithful Representation: To be reliable, information must represent faithfully the 
transactions and other events it either purports to represent or could reasonably be 
expected to represent. Thus, for example, a balance sheet should represent faithfully 
the transactions and other events that result in assets, liabilities and equity of the 
enterprise at the reporting date which meet the recognition criteria. 
Most financial information is subject to some risk of being less than a faithful 
representation of that which it purports to portray. This is not due to bias, but rather 
to inherent difficulties either in identifying the transactions and other events to be 
measured or in devising and applying measurement and presentation techniques that 
can convey messages that correspond with those transactions and events. In certain

ACCOUNTING 
1.52 
 
1.52 
cases, the measurement of the financial effects of items could be so uncertain that 
enterprises generally would not recognise them in the financial statements; for 
example, although most enterprises generate goodwill internally over time, it is usually 
difficult to identify or measure that goodwill reliably. In other cases, however, it may be 
relevant to recognise items and to disclose the risk of error surrounding their 
recognition and measurement. 
7. 
Substance over Form: If information is to represent faithfully the transactions and other 
events that it purports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for and 
presented in accordance with their substance and economic reality and not merely 
their legal form. The substance of transactions   or other events is not always consistent 
with that which is apparent from their legal or contrived form. For example, where 
rights and beneficial interest in an immovable property are transferred but the 
documentations 
and 
legal 
formalities 
are 
pending, 
the 
recording 
of 
acquisition/disposal (by the transferee and transferor respectively) would in substance 
represent the transaction entered into. 
8. 
Neutrality: To be reliable, the information contained in financial statements must be 
neutral, that is, free from bias. Financial statements are not neutral if, by the selection 
or presentation of information, they influence the making of a decision or judgement 
in order to achieve a predetermined result or outcome. 
9. 
Prudence: The preparers of financial statements have to contend with the uncertainties 
that inevitably surround many events and circumstances, such as the collectability of 
receivables, the probable useful life of plant and machinery, and the warranty claims 
that may occur. Such uncertainties are recognised by the disclosure of their nature and 
extent and by the exercise of prudence in the preparation of the financial statements. 
Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of caution in the exercise of the judgments 
needed in making the estimates required under conditions of uncertainty, such that 
assets or income are not overstated and liabilities or expenses are not understated. 
However, the exercise of prudence does not allow, for example, the creation of hidden 
reserves or excessive provisions, the deliberate understatement of assets or income, or 
the deliberate overstatement of liabilities or expenses, because the financial statements 
would then not be neutral and, therefore, not have the quality of reliability. 
10. 
Full, fair and adequate disclosure:  The financial statement must disclose all the reliable 
and relevant information about the business enterprise to the management and also to 
their external users for which they are meant, which in turn will help them to take a 
reasonable and rational decision. For it, it is necessary that financial statements are 
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles i.e the 
information is accounted for and presented in accordance with its substance and 
© The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
 
1.53 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
economic reality and not merely with its legal form. The disclosure should be full and 
final so that users can correctly assess the financial position of the enterprise. 
The principle of full disclosure implies that nothing should be omitted while principle 
of fair disclosure implies that all the transactions recorded should be accounted in a 
manner that financial statement purports true and fair view of the results of the 
business of the enterprise and adequate disclosure implies that the information 
influencing the decision of the users should be disclosed in detail and should make 
sense. 
This principle is widely used in corporate organizations because of separation in 
management and ownership. The Companies Act in pursuant of this principle came 
out with the format of balance sheet and profit and loss account. The disclosures of all 
the major accounting policies and other information are to be provided in the form of 
footnotes, annexures etc. The practice of appending notes to the financial statements 
is the outcome of this principle. 
11. 
Completeness: To be reliable, the information in financial statements must be 
complete within the bounds of materiality and cost. An omission can cause information 
to be false or misleading and thus unreliable and deficient in terms of its relevance. 
Thus, if accounting information is to present faithfully the transactions and other events 
that it purports to represent, it is necessary that they are accounted for and presented 
in accordance with their substance and economic reality, not by their legal form. For 
example, if a business enterprise sells its assets to others but still uses the assets as 
usual for the purpose of the business by making some arrangement with the seller, it 
simply becomes a legal transaction. The economic reality is that the business is using 
the assets as usual for deriving the benefit. Financial statement information should 
contain the substance of this transaction and should not only record going by legality. 
In order to be reliable, the financial statements information should be neutral i.e., free 
from bias. The prepares of financial statements however, have to contend with the 
uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances, such as the 
collectability of doubtful receivables, the probable useful life of plant and equipment 
and the number of warranty claims that many occur. Such uncertainties are recognised 
by the disclosure of their nature and extent and by exercise of prudence in the 
preparation of financial statements.  Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of caution 
in the exercise of judgement needed in making the estimates required under condition 
of uncertainty such that assets and income are not overstated and loss and liability are 
not understated.

should only be taken into consideration. In the financial statements of the organization 
if any revenue is recognized then expenses related to earn that revenue should also be 
recognized.

recognised on mercantile basis i.e., when they occur (and not as cash or a cash 
equivalent is received or paid) and they are recorded in the accounting records and 
reported in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate. 
4. 
False: The Realisation Concept states that no change should be counted unless it has 
materialised. 
5.

introduction of improved method of accounting.

Theoretical Questions 
1. 
(i)  
Fundamental accounting assumptions: There are three fundamental 
accounting assumptions: Going Concern; Consistency and Accrual. If nothing 
has been written about the fundamental accounting assumption in the financial 
statements then it is assumed that they have already been followed in their 
preparation of financial statements. 
(ii) 
Periodicity concept: According to this concept accounts should be prepared after 
every period & not at the end of the life of the entity. For details, refer para 2.5.

(i) 
Distinction between Money measurement concepts and matching concept 
As per Money Measurement concept, only those transactions, which can be 
measured in terms of money are recorded. Since money is the medium of 
exchange and the standard of economic value, this concept requires that those 
transactions alone that are capable of being measured in terms of money be 
only to be recorded in the books of accounts.  Transactions and events that 
cannot be expressed in terms of money are not recorded in the business books. 
In Matching concept all expenses matched with the revenue of that period 
should only be taken into consideration.  In the financial statements of the 
organization if any revenue is recognized them expenses related to earn that 
revenue should also be recognized. 
(ii)    Distinction between Going concern and cost concept 
Going Concern Concept 
The financial statements are normally prepared on the assumption that an 
enterprise is a going concern and will continue in operation for the foreseeable 
future. 
Cost concept 
By this concept, the value of an asset is to be determined on the basis of 
historical cost, in other words, acquisition cost. For details refer para 2.5. 
3. 
Qualitative characteristics are the attributes that make the information provided in 
financial statements useful to users. For details, refer para 2.7.1.
